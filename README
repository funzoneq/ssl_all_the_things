Trying to download all the SSL certificate chains in the 2^32 space.

This project has a:
# Client
Scans only port 443 at the moment.
# Server
Small and simple django app.

How does it work?
------
1: Setup the django application, an howto is provided in 'server/start.txt
2: Setup the worker in ./worker/. The start app is: "job_sechduler.sh"
3: Worker needs to do a get at http://django/get/ it will get a text file with a 0.0.0.0/24 subnet and ip's in octets.
4: Worker starts scanning and when it's done it will post back an ip from the iprange received to: http://django/done/8.8.8.8
5: Worker goes back to point 3
6: When no data has been received for more then 30 minuts from a certain job id, it will release the job again to a worker
7: ...
8: ALL YOUR CERTIFICATES BELONG TO US and ready to be datacrunched and plotted.
